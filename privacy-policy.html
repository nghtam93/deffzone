                  <h3>WILL WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users’ personal information to others. We may transfer personal data to our service providers or third parties in connection with DeffZone’s operation of its business, as certain features on DeffZone rely on various third-party products and services (collectively “Third Party Services”), . These third party services providers only have access to certain Personal Information, such as your public Wallet addresses, to perform their functions and may not use it for other purposes. Furthermore, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protections laws. Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that TrustWallet or substantially all of its assets are acquired, users' information will be one of the transferred assets. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners- like publishers, advertisers, developers, or right holders.

                  <h3>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER</h3>
                  <p>
                    We primarily use the limited information that we collect to enhance DeffZone. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your Personal Information. Some ways we may use your Personal Information are to: Contact you when necessary; Respond to your comments, questions, or issues related to bugs or errors with DeffZone; Provide you with additional information; Send you information and marketing materials about services and products available through DeffZone, using push notifications or other means; Train our team members; Other internal business purposes. Aggregated Personal Data and Non-Personal Information We may share or disclose aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal Information with service providers or with other persons we conduct business with, including but not limited potential third-parties for the purpose of showcasing the performance of the company. These service providers and other persons may also share with us aggregated Non-Personal Information that they have independently developed or acquired. Additionally, we may combine aggregate information from the pixel tags, and web beacons, with similar data we collect from other visitors to help us improve our Services. When doing so, we do our best to ensure that aggregated information cannot be linked back to you. Agents or Third Party Partners We may provide your Personal Information to our employees, contractors, agents, service providers, and designees (“Agents”) to enable them to perform certain services for us, including improvement of website-related services and features, and performance of maintenance services. Business Transfers We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. By accepting this Privacy Notice, as outlined above, you consent to any such transfer. Protection of Us and Others We will share personal information outside of DeffZone if we have a reasonable belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; to cooperate with law enforcement; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DeffZone, our employees, our users, or others.

Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use.
